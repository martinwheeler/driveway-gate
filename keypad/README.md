# Password

To configure a password first duplicate the `config.example.h` file and remove the word `example` from the new file.

E.g. `config.example.h` -> `config.h`

Open up the newly created file and edit the constant variable `PASSWORD`. This is what the user must enter on the keypad before the gates will open.
